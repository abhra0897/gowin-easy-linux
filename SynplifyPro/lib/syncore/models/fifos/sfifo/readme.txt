The SYNCORE FIFO compiler helps designers create FIFO models for their designs.
These FIFO models are written out in HDL and can be synthesized as well as simulated.
A testbench is provided for the FIFO models created by the SYNCORE FIFO compiler.

For detailed information on the SYNCORE FIFO compiler and its various options, click 
the FIFO Info button at the bottom of this window.

Known Issues:
1. Avoid using space character for component name, file name & in directory path. 
2. Testbench covers limited set of vectors for testing.
3. FIFO models will not be implemented using dedicated FIFO blocks available in certain technologies.
   Might be supported in future releases of Synplify.
