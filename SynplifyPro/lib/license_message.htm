                <b>You have a license file, but you are unable to use it.</b>&nbsp;
                Please refer to the current version of the Synopsys Common Licensing Administration Guide available on the
                SolvNet Documentation page (click Licensing in the list of titles in the column on the right). If your
                licenses are centrally administered by your company, you may also want to consult your software system administrator. Note
                that this software version requires setting either the LM_LICENSE_FILE or the SNPSLMD_LICENSE_FILE environment variable, and
                that the SYNPLCTYD_LICENSE_FILE variable is no longer used.

                or you have not yet installed a license file</b>.&nbsp;
                You can obtain an up-to-date license file from your Synopsys SolvNet account,
                accessible at the following link: <a href="https://solvnet.synopsys.com">https://solvnet.synopsys.com</a>. To
                initially register for a SolvNet account, you will need to know your
                Company’s Synopsys SiteID. To obtain your SiteID please contact your
                software system administrator or the person responsible for purchasing your
                license. If you are still unable to locate your SiteID, please send an
                email to <a href="mailto:solvnetfeedback@synopsys.com">solvnetfeedback@synopsys.com</a>,
                stating your name, company name, division and company address. Note that this software version requires a license
                generated on or after September 7, 2010.<P style="MARGIN-TOP: 4px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 4px; LINE-HEIGHT: 100%">&nbsp;<P></P>
